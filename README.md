# 🧪 Leads Magnet App — Unit Testing Practice

Welcome to my unit testing practice repository! This project follows along with a comprehensive course covering real-world testing techniques in Kotlin using **JUnit**, **MockK**, **Coroutines**, **Flows**, and **Code Coverage**.

## 📚 Course Progress & Topics Covered

### ✅ Getting Started
- Leads Magnet App Introduction
- Setting up the first unit test for the Leads Controller
- Making the first test pass
- Validating user input (First Name, Last Name, Phone Number)

### 🔍 JUnit Essentials
- `@Before`, `@After`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll` explained
- Handling exceptions and ignoring tests

### 🎭 Test Doubles & MockK Library
- What are Dummies, Stubs, Fakes, Mocks, and Spies?
- Strict vs Relaxed mocking
- Spies as stubs
- Argument capturing and matchers

### 🔄 Coroutine Testing
- Intro to Coroutine Unit Testing
- Standard vs Unconfined Test Dispatchers
- Writing coroutine-based Use Cases (e.g., `GetProfileUseCase`)
- Sequential vs Parallel coroutine timing
- Mocking coroutines with MockK
- Using virtual clocks in tests via Dispatcher injection

### 🧠 ViewModel & UI State Testing
- Creating and testing `ProfileViewModel` using `MutableStateFlow`
- UI state management and assertions
- Main Dispatcher rule setup

### 🌊 Flow Unit Testing
- Cold Flow testing
- Hot Flow (`StateFlow`, `SharedFlow`) testing
- Flow test strategies
- Using Turbine & Kluent for assertion clarity
- Refactoring and testing with Flows

### 📈 Code Coverage
- Introduction to code coverage metrics
- Integrating **Kover** to measure test coverage
